Creating a complete task management system involves both frontend and backend development. Below is a simplified example using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, and Node.js with Express for the backend. For simplicity, I'm skipping the user authentication part, but you can add it as a bonus feature.

To run this, you need to have Node.js installed. Save the frontend files in a folder, and the backend file (server.js) in a separate folder. Open a terminal in each folder, run npm init -y to create package.json, and then run npm install express body-parser to install the necessary packages.

Start the backend server by running node server.js. Open the index.html (localhost:5500) file in a browser to use the task management system.

Note: This is a simple example and may not be suitable for production. Additional error handling, validation, and security measures should be implemented for a production-ready application.
